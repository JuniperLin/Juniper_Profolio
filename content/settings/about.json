  "paragraph1": "I am Juniper. My background is a hybrid of international sales, complex logistics, and frontend engineering. From managing warehouse supply chains in Australia to consulting on corporate travel at Lion Travel, I’ve spent years mastering the art of operational efficiency and human connection. I don’t just write code; I build digital systems that respect your business logic and serve real people.\n<br>\n我是 Juniper。我不只是一名工程師，我是一個擁有豐富商業實戰經驗的技術人。在投入前端開發之前，我在跨國業務與物流領域深耕超過五年，從澳洲的倉儲供應鏈管理到雄獅旅行社的企業差旅顧問，這些經歷教會我如何優化流程與精準溝通。我寫的不只是程式碼，而是能真正解決商業問題、且符合人性直覺的數位系統。",
  "paragraph2": "Because you don't need a developer who blindly follows instructions; you need a partner who understands the market. I combine the empathetic communication of a sales veteran with the structural precision of a logistics expert. I build websites that are not just visually striking, but functionally robust—designed to guide your customers seamlessly from \"visitor\" to \"buyer,\" ensuring your digital presence is an asset, not an expense.\n<br>\n因為你需要的不是一個只會聽指令的工程師，而是一個懂市場的合作夥伴。我結合了資深業務的同理心溝通，以及物流專家的精準架構思維。我為你打造的網站不會只有外表好看，更具備強大的功能邏輯——就像精心規劃的物流動線一樣，引導你的客戶順暢地完成從「瀏覽」到「下單」的過程，確保你的網站是幫你賺錢的資產，而不只是消耗預算的支出。",
  "whyMattersTitle": "Why does this matter to you?",
  "whyMattersContent": "Because I don't look at a website as just a collection of <div> tags. I see it as a digital storefront that needs to convert, function, and serve real humans. I combine technical precision with empathy to build tools that actually work for your business."
